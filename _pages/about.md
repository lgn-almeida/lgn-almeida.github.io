Hi! My name is Luiz, and I am a Postdoctoral Researcher and Bioinformatician at the Dufour Lab. Currently, I am finalizing the machine learning models developed during my Ph.D. and preparing a publication to share our exciting results. In parallel, I assist the Dufour Lab with the bioinformatics analysis of proteomics datasets, working closely with lab members and external collaborators, including assistant professors and clinicians.

My background and history
------
I am originally from Brazil, where I earned a B.Sc. in Biotechnology from the Federal University of Alfenas and an M.Sc. in Basic and Applied Immunology from the University of São Paulo. During my undergraduate studies, I had the opportunity to spend one year as an exchange student at the University of California, San Diego (USA). I later moved to Canada to pursue a Ph.D. in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology with a specialization in Bioinformatics. I conducted my research in the Dufour Lab at the University of Calgary and recently completed my degree in April 2025.


My work and research
------
My entire academic career has been shaped by a focus on translational research. During my undergraduate studies, I worked on vaccine development against Dengue fever and *Pseudomonas aeruginosa* in the Coelho Lab, where Dr. Coelho also sparked my long-standing interest in immunology. As an exchange student in the USA, I joined the Spector Lab at the University of California, San Diego, where I continued my work on vaccine development—this time focusing on Herpes Simplex Virus Type II.

For my master’s degree, I joined the Santos Lab, which collaborated closely with the Ferreira Lab on the development of a chimeric vaccine against ticks in cattle. This project involved combining multiple protein components, requiring bioinformatics tools for epitope prediction. The ability to integrate biology, computation, and statistics deepened my interest in bioinformatics and led me to pursue a Ph.D. in the Dufour Lab, where I focused on proteomics to better understand disease mechanisms and discover biomarkers.

In my Ph.D. research, I analyzed multiple omics datasets, including mass spectrometry and affinity-based platforms (SomaLogic and Olink), to identify biomarkers capable of distinguishing inflammatory from stricturing Crohn’s disease. I developed a robust pipeline incorporating three feature selection methods and ten machine learning algorithms, and I further leveraged single-cell RNA-seq data to map the potential cellular sources of the biomarkers. Currently, I aim to expand my expertise in machine learning and AI-based methods to further advance bioinformatics-driven discoveries. I am also looking forward to deepen my knowledge of other emerging omics technologies, such as spatial omics, to enhance the biological context and translational relevance of my analyses.
