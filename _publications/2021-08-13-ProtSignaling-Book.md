Abstract: <br>
Proteases are essential enzymes involved in multiple biological processes, including the regulation of inflammation. They have been shown to modify cytokine and chemokine activity to initiate and terminate proinflammatory or antiinflammatory responses. The dichotomy in the biological roles that proteases exert is essential to drive acute inflammation toward the resolution phase to later return to homeostasis. However, when left unchecked, proteases can also promote inflammatory diseases. In acute inflammatory diseases, such as sepsis, proteases play key roles in the coagulation cascade, leading to a hypercoagulable state and cytokine storms. In chronic inflammatory diseases, such as Crohn’s disease, proteases can regulate leukocyte recruitment, tissue damage, and impact resistance to certain treatments. Importantly, proteases play both protective and detrimental roles in inflammatory diseases. Therefore, a better characterization of their roles in inflammation could result in new drug targets’ identification and more effective treatment plans for patients.
