Abstract:<br>
Cystatin C (CyC), a secreted cysteine protease inhibitor, has unclear biological functions. Many patients exhibit elevated plasma CyC levels, particularly during glucocorticoid (GC) treatment. This study links GCs with CyCâ€™s systemic regulation by utilizing genome-wide association and structural equation modeling to determine CyC production genetics in the UK Biobank. Both CyC production and a polygenic score (PGS) capturing predisposition to CyC production were associated with increased all-cause and cancer-specific mortality. We found that the GC receptor directly targets CyC, leading to GC-responsive CyC secretion in macrophages and cancer cells. CyC-knockout tumors displayed significantly reduced growth and diminished recruitment of TREM2+ macrophages, which have been connected to cancer immunotherapy failure. Furthermore, the CyC-production PGS predicted checkpoint immunotherapy failure in 685 patients with metastatic cancer from combined clinical trial cohorts. In conclusion, CyC may act as a GC effector pathway via TREM2+ macrophage recruitment and may be a potential target for combination cancer immunotherapy.
