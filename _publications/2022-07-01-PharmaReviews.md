Abstract: <br>
The first matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) was discovered in 1962 from the tail of a tadpole by its ability to degrade collagen. As their name suggests, matrix metalloproteinases are proteases capable of remodeling the extracellular matrix. More recently, MMPs have been demonstrated to play numerous additional biologic roles in cell signaling, immune regulation, and transcriptional control, all of which are unrelated to the degradation of the extracellular matrix. In this review, we will present milestones and major discoveries of MMP research, including various clinical trials for the use of MMP inhibitors. We will discuss the reasons behind the failures of most MMP inhibitors for the treatment of cancer and inflammatory diseases. There are still misconceptions about the pathophysiological roles of MMPs and the best strategies to inhibit their detrimental functions. This review aims to discuss MMPs in preclinical models and human pathologies. We will discuss new biochemical tools to track their proteolytic activity in vivo and ex vivo, in addition to future pharmacological alternatives to inhibit their detrimental functions in diseases.
